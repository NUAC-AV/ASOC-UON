## Overview
This project provides Python scripts to read data from an ASOC_Walks_Database Google Sheets document, which is used to create an interactive map with markers using the `folium` library. The map is saved as an HTML file, which can be viewed in any web browser.

[Google Sheets Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mGR_xugxcg3Pc3e1KLzggZn6XfnSJOuHncZ64hOo8M4/edit?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR3rcnaz2qedGxf1LaI0fz7X7gUQiZrvZTjs3x-MfPTNZODKO8ykz3piWDI_aem_mtzQRofiQxsPinF7C6uSHg&gid=0#gid=0)

## Features
- Read data from "ASOC_Walks_Database"
- Create an interactive map from the database
- Add markers for each location with popups containing relevant information
- Save the map as an HTML file

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pandas` library
- `folium` library
- `gpxpy` library
- `pdf2image` library
- `Pillow` library
